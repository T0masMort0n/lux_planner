## PHASE 1 — SYSTEM FOUNDATION (Current)

✔ AppShell layout  
✔ Overlay navigation  
✔ Theme system  
✔ Feature registry
✔ Scheduler MVP Loop validated as system surface
  
✔ Modular project structure  

**Now includes:**

- Universal Drag & Drop system
- Explore Mode framework
- Sharing infrastructure (copy-first)
- Template Pack system (playlist model)
- Contacts + Relationship Tiers
- Pack import & deduplication logic
- System Area Taxonomy
- Visual Designer role integration

Focus:

- Color and contrast tuning
- Spacing rhythm
- Elevation and visual depth
- Visual calmness optimization

---

## PHASE 5 — EXTENSION
