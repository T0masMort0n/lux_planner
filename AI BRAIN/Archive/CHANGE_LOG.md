## 2026-02-06 — System Contracts & Governance Consolidation
**User Problem / Goal:**  
Prevent system drift and ensure all future development aligns with interaction-first life system design.

**What Changed (high level):**  
- Adopted System Interaction Contracts as governing law  
- Defined Drag/Drop, Explore Mode, Sharing, Packs as system frameworks  
- Introduced Visual Designer role  
- Formalized admin governance (Product Driver + AI)

**Why This Matters:**  
Establishes Lux as a coherent platform rather than feature collection.

**Rules / Constraints Updated:**  
System contracts now override local design choices.

**Follow-ups / TODOs:**  
- Implement system service scaffolding
- Expand pack adapters

**Signed:** Product Driver & AI Admin
