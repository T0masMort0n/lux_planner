# PROJECT_ROADMAP

This roadmap defines the intended phases. Agents should align their recommendations to the current phase unless the Product Driver explicitly changes priorities.

---

## PHASE 1 — SYSTEM FOUNDATION (Current)

✔ AppShell layout
✔ Overlay navigation
✔ Theme system
✔ Feature registry
✔ Modular project structure

Focus now:
- stabilize UX behaviors (smooth, calm, interruption-safe)
- ensure system UI primitives are robust
- enforce boundaries (no feature-level theme/motion/navigation)

---

## PHASE 2 — CORE FEATURES

- Journal module
- Scheduler module
- Shared data interfaces

---

## PHASE 3 — CROSS-FEATURE INTERACTION

- Linking journal to days
- Tasks visible in scheduler
- Habit data influencing planner

NOTE: This phase requires system-level interfaces/services. No feature-to-feature imports.

---

## PHASE 4 — POLISH LAYER

- Typography refinement
- Spacing system
- Motion consistency

---

## PHASE 5 — EXTENSION

- Meals app
- Exercise app
- Goals app

---

## PHASE 6 — SYSTEM INTELLIGENCE

- Smart suggestions
- Behavior insights
- Automation layer
