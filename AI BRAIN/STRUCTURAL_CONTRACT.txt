Lux Planner — MVP UI Structural Contract

This document defines the system-owned UI foundation for Lux Planner.
It is the structural contract that all features must plug into during Phase 1 (System Foundation).

It ensures:

• Layout is system-owned
• Motion is system-owned
• Theme is system-owned
• Navigation is system-owned
• Features supply content only

This contract prevents UI drift and eliminates feature-level layout invention.

1️⃣ SYSTEM LAYOUT PATTERN (AppShell)

The application UI is composed of a stable, system-owned skeleton.

AppShell Regions
Region	Owner	Purpose
Global Header (optional)	System	Global app identity and global controls only
Left Panel	System container	Feature navigation, filters, mode switches, feature actions
Right Panel	System container	Feature content surface
Fixed vs Variable
Element	Fixed by System	Variable by Feature
Split layout	✅	❌
Panel sizing rules	✅	❌
Padding, spacing tokens	✅	❌
Scroll containment	✅	❌
Panel contents	❌	✅ (content only)
Feature Integration Model

Features provide:

FeatureLeftPanelWidget
FeatureRightViewWidget


The system mounts these inside pre-defined containers.
Features may not create alternative shells, panels, or layout systems.

2️⃣ LEFT PANEL CONTRACT

The left panel uses one shared structural pattern.

System-Owned Structure

• Vertical stack container
• Standard padding/insets
• Scroll container
• Section label component
• List-item button component
• Divider rules

Feature-Provided Content

Features provide:

• Section titles (strings)
• Item labels
• Item ordering
• Action labels
• Callback handlers

Features do not control layout, spacing, styling, or hover/selected behavior.

Section Pattern
[Section Label]
[Item]
[Item]
[Item]

[Section Label]
[Item]

Control Types
Type	Behavior
Navigation item	Changes right panel content within feature
Action item	Executes feature command

Both render using system button primitives.

Spacing & Rhythm

Defined entirely by system spacing tokens.
Features may not hardcode margins/padding.

Scroll Behavior

Left panel content scrolls within left panel.
AppShell itself never scrolls.

3️⃣ RIGHT VIEW CONTRACT

The right panel is a system-owned content frame with three zones.

Zone Structure
Zone	Owner	Purpose
Title Zone	System	Uses TitleUnified component
Meta Zone (optional)	System	Caption/meta text using system style
Content Body	Feature (inside system container)	Main feature view
Feature Responsibilities

Features provide only:

• Title text
• Meta text (optional)
• Content widget

Features may not alter padding, scroll logic, or outer layout.

Scroll Model

Default:

• Title & Meta remain fixed
• Body scrolls inside system scroll container

If a feature view requires custom scroll behavior (e.g., scheduler grid), it must still remain inside the system frame.

Compatibility Examples
Feature	Title	Meta	Body
Journal	"Journal"	Date / notebook	Editor
Scheduler	"Scheduler"	Current range	Time grid
Goals	"Goals"	Active filter	List/cards

All fit within the same contract.

4️⃣ SHARED UI PRIMITIVES (System-Owned Minimum)

These are the only primitives features may rely on.

Structural

• AppShell
• LeftPanelContainer
• RightPanelFrame

Typography

• TitleUnified
• MetaCaption
• SectionLabel

Buttons

• ListItemButton
• PrimaryButton
• SecondaryButton

Surfaces

• Card / Surface container
• Divider

Tokens

• Spacing scale
• Radius tokens
• Elevation tokens

Features must not invent alternatives.

5️⃣ INTERACTION MODEL RULES

These govern system behavior.

Rule	Description
No layout jumps	Feature switching must not change shell dimensions
Interruption-safe animations	Rapid interaction cannot break transitions
Stable left panel	Structure remains identical across features
Content-only swapping	Right panel swaps content without shell reflow
State safety	Rapid clicks, resizes, and transitions must not wedge UI

All motion is system-owned.

6️⃣ SYSTEM VS FEATURE RESPONSIBILITY
Concern	System Owns	Feature Owns
Layout structure	✅	❌
Panel sizing	✅	❌
Motion/animation	✅	❌
Theme/styling	✅	❌
Navigation	✅	❌
Spacing rules	✅	❌
Typography primitives	✅	❌
Button components	✅	❌
Panel containers	✅	❌
Left panel labels/content	❌	✅
Right view widgets	❌	✅
View-specific UI state	❌	✅
Cross-feature communication	✅ (via system/core)	❌
Final Principle

The system defines how the app looks, moves, and is structured.
Features define what appears inside that structure.

This contract is the UI foundation of Lux Planner.
